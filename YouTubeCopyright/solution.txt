*** For all PS4 games ***
I purchased a license to consume [NAME OF GAME] on Sony Playstation 4.  This includes use of all of its intended features, including the Share button exclusive to PS4 games.  The video is 100% streamed by use of the PS4's Share button, which already strips copyrighted material that I am not licensed to stream.  I am also not using the material to sell a membership or to promote a product.

*** Specific to WWE 2K17 ***
I purchased a license to consume WWE 2K17 on Sony Playstation 4.  This includes use of all of its intended features, including the Share button exclusive to PS4 games.  The video is 100% streamed by use of the PS4's Share button, which already strips copyrighted material that I am not licensed to stream (such as the menu music, which only I can hear while playing, but viewers can not hear due to Sony's extensive digital rights management).  I am also not using the material to sell a membership or to promote a product.
